                     Defaults to `False`.

                    This cannot be `True` if `passwords` are also specified.
            passwords: A list of plain text passwords to add to or remove from the user.

                        must be prefixed with either a '+' to add the category
                        permission or a '-' to remove the category permission.
            commands: A list of strings representing command permissions. Each string
                      must be prefixed with either a '+' to add the command permission
                      or a '-' to remove the command permission.
            keys: A list of key patterns to grant the user access to. Key patterns allow
                  ``'*'`` to support wildcard matching. For example, ``'*'`` grants
                  access to all keys while ``'cache:*'`` grants access to all keys that
                  are prefixed with ``cache:``.
                  `keys` should not be prefixed with a ``'~'``.
            reset: Indicates whether the user should be fully reset prior to applying
                   the new ACL. Setting this to `True` will remove all existing
                   passwords, flags, and privileges from the user and then apply the

                        prior to applying any new key permissions specified in `keys`.
                        If `False`, the user's existing key permissions will be kept and
                        any new specified key permissions will be applied on top.
            reset_channels: Indicates whether the user's channel permissions should be
                            reset prior to applying any new channel permissions
                            specified in `channels`. If `False`, the user's existing
